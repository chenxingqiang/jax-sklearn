# SL Mode Algorithms (Split Learning)

Total: 116 algorithms with model splitting support

## Characteristics

- Model split across parties
- Each party holds part of the model
- Forward/backward computed collaboratively
- Encrypted intermediate activations
- Best for neural networks and deep models

## Usage

```python
from xlearn._secretflow.generated.sl_mlpclassifier import SLMLPClassifier

# Model split across alice and bob
model = SLMLPClassifier(
    devices={'alice': alice, 'bob': bob}
)

model.fit(fed_X, fed_y, epochs=10)
```

## All 116 SL Algorithms

Every algorithm from SS/FL modes also available in SL mode,
enabling model-split training for maximum flexibility.
